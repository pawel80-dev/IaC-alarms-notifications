# IaC-alarms-notifications

> For most of my projects, the leading branch is the **dev** one. That means that *_dev.yaml file is the most frequently used workflow/pipeline.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate Cisco Manager alarm notifications with Twilio and Whatsapp. Manager and Twilio code changes are pushed via Github workflow.
